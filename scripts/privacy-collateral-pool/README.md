# Privacy Collateral Pool

A privacy-preserving mixing pool implementation using Noir zero-knowledge proofs. This project allows users to deposit and withdraw funds while maintaining transaction privacy through cryptographic commitments and Merkle tree proofs.

## How It Works

Privacy Pool operates on the principle of **commitment schemes** and **zero-knowledge proofs** to break the link between deposits and withdrawals:

1. **Deposit**: When users deposit funds, they generate a secret commitment that represents their deposit without revealing the amount or their identity.

2. **Merkle Tree**: All commitments are stored in a binary Merkle tree, creating a cryptographic structure that allows proving membership without revealing which specific commitment belongs to whom.

3. **Withdrawal**: To withdraw funds, users generate a zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates:
   - They know the secret to a valid commitment in the tree
   - They haven't already spent this commitment (nullifier mechanism)
   - The withdrawal amount is valid

4. **Privacy**: Since the proof doesn't reveal which commitment is being spent, withdrawals are unlinkable to deposits, providing transaction privacy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest version)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or higher)

### Running the Web Application Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd privacy_pool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Install web-app dependencies
   cd web-app
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   # From the web-app directory
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the Privacy Pool interface.

### Using the CLI Scripts

From the root directory, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize the system
bun run init

# Make a deposit
bun run deposit

# Make a withdrawal
bun run withdraw

# Generate a proof
bun run gen-proof

# Get latest note information
bun run get-latest-note
```

## Project Components

### Core Circuit (`src/main.nr`)
The Noir circuit that handles the zero-knowledge proof generation and verification:
- **Hash Function**: Uses SHA-256 compression for creating commitments
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Validates that a commitment exists in the tree
- **Nullifier System**: Prevents double-spending of commitments

### CLI Scripts (`scripts/`)
Command-line tools for interacting with the privacy pool:

#### Core Scripts
- **`init.ts`**: Initializes the privacy pool system and storage
- **`deposit.ts`**: Handles deposit operations and commitment generation
- **`withdraw.ts`**: Processes withdrawal requests with proof generation
- **`gen_proof.ts`**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs for withdrawals
- **`get_latest_note.ts`**: Retrieves the user's current note information
- **`gen_input.ts`**: Generates input data for proof generation

#### Library Components (`scripts/lib/`)
- **`constants.ts`**: System configuration (tree depth, zero values, etc.)
- **`storage.ts`**: Persistent storage management for notes and tree state
- **`index.ts`**: Utility functions and common operations
- **`types.ts`**: TypeScript type definitions for notes and commitments

### Web Application (`web-app/`)
A React-based user interface for interacting with the privacy pool:

#### Frontend Components
- **`BankingInterface.tsx`**: Main interface for deposits, withdrawals, and balance management
- **`ui/`**: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
- **`pages/`**: Application pages and routing

#### Frontend Libraries
- **`storage.ts`**: Browser-side storage management
- **`types.ts`**: Frontend type definitions
- **`utils.ts`**: Utility functions including proof generation
- **`constants.ts`**: Frontend configuration constants

### Configuration Files
- **`Nargo.toml`**: Noir project configuration and dependencies
- **`package.json`**: Node.js dependencies and scripts
- **`Prover.toml`**: Proof generation parameters and test data
